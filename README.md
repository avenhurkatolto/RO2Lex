The program can be run with the .apk file in the root directory.

One of my first and as of today my only successful project for a small Ragnarok Online 2 community.
The program helps tracking one's skill (save/loadable).
Also, it can calculate the Mastery Level points (ML points) for some objects in the game.
I had other features planned to implement, but due to the game's significantly decreased  userbase and my lack of time, I dropped the project.
